# What is this projct
## This is a web app to showcase my python projects.
### In contact me the send email function seems to work locally but not when deployed.
### It seems to me that it has to do with our private mail server. My guess is that it is somehow flagging streamlit-hosted apps as insecure. I’m not sure why no errors are thrown, but seeing as how it works when deployed locally and I’ve exhausted implementation options, I think I’ll just have to either host a new mail server that I have more fine-grained control over or host my streamlit app elsewhere.
